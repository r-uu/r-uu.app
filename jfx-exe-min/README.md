Minimal app to demonstrate the customisation of native image generation with jpackage for maven multi module projects using javafx with jpms.

This app is inspired by [Konrad Neitzels project on github](https://github.com/kneitzel/JavaFXMavenApp/tree/main/src/main/java/de/kneitzel).

# [jfx-exe-min](#jfx-exe-min)

  contains base configuration with minimal adjustments
  - maven artifact name
  - maven multi module project structure
  - java package names

# [jfx-exe-main-1 introduce jpms](#jfx-exe-main-1)

  same as [jfx-exe-min](jfx-exe-min) but with ```module-info.java```
