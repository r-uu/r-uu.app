# Checking for Updates

Regular updates of plugins and dependencies are crucial for software development for several reasons. First, they 
ensure security by keeping all components up-to-date and closing known vulnerabilities. Second, updates often include
optimizations and bug fixes, which improve the performance and stability of the software. Third, updating allows access
to new features and technologies, making development more efficient and future-proof. Regular updates also ensure
compatibility with other tools and systems, simplifying integration and maintenance.

## Codehaus version plugin

The Codehaus Versions Maven Plugin is a valuable tool in software development, as it checks for newer versions of
plugins or dependencies. It assists developers in keeping their projects up-to-date by automatically searching for
updates and suggesting possible upgrades. This functionality is especially important to ensure that the components
used are current and to benefit from the latest security patches, bug fixes, and performance improvements. The plugin
offers a simple and efficient way to optimize software maintenance and enhance software quality.

## Inclusion in project

The plugin can easily be added to the maven project:
```xml
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
                <artifactId>versions-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>${codehaus.version.plugin}</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <phase>validate</phase>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>display-dependency-updates</goal>
                            <goal>display-plugin-updates</goal>
                            <goal>display-property-updates</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
```

It is important, that we start the goals to display updates for dependencies, plugins and also properties.

## Problems

The availability of updates for plugins and dependencies in a Maven project can sometimes depend on the version of
Maven being used. Newer versions of Maven often support more current plugins and dependencies, which can offer improved
features and security updates. Therefore, it is important to ensure that a project is operated with a specific, minimum
required version of Maven.

To enforce this, the Maven Enforcer Plugin can be utilized. This plugin allows specific rules to be enforced within
the build environment, including the requirement for a minimum Maven version. By configuring the Maven Enforcer Plugin
in the build process, it is ensured that the build only proceeds successfully if the Maven version used meets the
defined minimum requirement. This helps to avoid inconsistencies and potential errors due to version conflicts,
promoting the stability and security of the project.

Inclusion of the maven enforcer plugin:
```xml
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-enforcer-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>${maven.enforcer.plugin}</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <id>enforce-versions</id>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>enforce</goal>
                        </goals>
                        <configuration>
                            <rules>
                                <requireMavenVersion>
                                    <version>${required.maven.version}</version>
                                </requireMavenVersion>
                            </rules>
                        </configuration>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
```
